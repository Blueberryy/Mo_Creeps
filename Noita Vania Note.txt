Damn it, they aren't adding to the pixel scenes they're just overriding them.

Best way around this is making a seperate mod called "Noitavania mo creeps compatibility" and having it be the same
pixelscene code but pointed towards noitavania's pixelscene file.

Would make it easier to change the x y positions too at least I guess, but remember to disable boss spawns if noitavania is enabled
And redo them in the fix mod.

For some reason checking if noitavania is loaded and changing the input data if so causes nxml to stop functioning.


Scratch all this, Noitavania compatibility is official!!!!
Though, the map is hell to navigate for me
