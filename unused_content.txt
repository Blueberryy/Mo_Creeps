This content is intended to be saved for later, to be added all in one big content update.
I may still add small things over time as I think of them, but keep them in a list here so I can keep track
of what I have & haven't finished implementing into the mod when I get around to putting them all in

Remember the checklist!!



Suspended Lava Tank - mods/mo_creeps/files/entities/props/suspended_tank_lava.xml
Essence of Fungus - mods/mo_creeps/files/entities/items/pickups/essence_fungus.xml (functional but can't redeem it anywhere)





1.1.0 Changelog:
Added 3 new environmental hazards
Added 3 new creeps
Added new biome variation to the world, explore the same biomes in wildly different ways!
Birthday event now occurs during July, this is when the mod first started being worked on.
Pandora's Chest now has more permanent effects
Added a new welcoming message for new users to Mo Creeps
Added a new essence to the world...
Red sand is now considerably more palatable...

Master of None can not longer shoot poly orbs, It's all fun and games until you get Polymorphed
Fixed Tnt Minecart Riders being a bit too jittery in their cart
Fixed Worse Enemies Weak Shotgunners not working with minecarts properly
Fixed Whisps not taking damage from Mass Wet
Fixed MOTDs not spawning in Noitavania
Fixed Minecart Hisii Snapping their wands in half upon entering a minecart
Fixed Blob cave not spawning properly in Noitavania
Fixed Acid Bubble not appearing in Conjurer
Fixed Devouring Ghosts eating magical liquids in the Void (modded biome)

Fixed Russian Translation not working on some status effects
Fixed Weak Hisii Shotgunners not jumping into minecarts
Fixed Hisii Shotgunners occasionally turning into their weaker versions in minecarts
Fixed Ceiling Fungus needing air to survive
Fixed some spells breaking in Spell Evolution compatibility mode. I don't know how much longer I'll keep proper translated support for the mod, especially since it's evolution's bug and not mine, but as long as it remains not too big a burden I'll maintain support.
Fixed a certain cat not eating the rat properly
Fixed Divine Being having much more health than intended in nightmare/purgatory
Fixed the Colossal Blob occasionally creating duplicate loot if baited offscreen
Fixed birthday rats spawning in the Powerplant at the wrong time
FIXED MAGIC DEVOURERS HAVING 90% DAMAGE REDUCTION FROM ALL SOURCES
Very slightly reduced blood produced by Angeling & Devilings
Red Sand now absorbs blood to grow
Reduced Sentry Damage in earlier parts of the game
Significantly reduced Sentry's range, he should now play a slightly different role than sniper by requiring a closer encounter but having better stats to cut through
Nerfed wand dropped by Pandora's Chest on normal difficulty
Mini Drones in earlier parts of the game are now more vulnerable to projectile damage
Slightly reduced Poring melee range
Significantly Reduced liquid produced by liquid bubbles in Purgatory & Nightmare. Previously they occasionally produced so much liquid it would forcefully clip through the floor and hurt you without warning
Reduced Poring damage in Coal Pits
Reduced Greater Cold Gazer's spawnrate in snowy depths
Slightly nerfed wand dropped by Toxic Worm Boss
Slightly Nerfed loot from Overzealous Polymage miniboss

Master of Mana are now considerably more tasty...
Master of Mana are now made out of Enchanted Meat
Significantly reduced blood bled by Master of Mana
Colossal & Creepy Blob are now immune to freezing, if you freeze melee them, it's possible for them to die before they spawn their babies, defeating the entire point behind the encounter, you're no longer challenged on your crowd-control ability
Added new Enlightened Alchemist variants 
Removed Cursed Orb Barrage. The spell felt unnecessary, it didn't introduce anything new and the method for unlocking it felt.. dumb, as if once you beat a Divine Being you had a 50% chance of getting a run winner from a Cursed Chest.. Perhaps it could make a combat later but for now it's removed until further notice.
Reduced Smoking Fungi's spawnrate in Fungal Caverns
Statues now spawn in the trophy room on the same run you achieve them
New Experimental Spell: Targetter, this spell will have the same effect Forsaken eyes & Observers have, it's experimental since I really like the concept of a "friendly fire this guy" spell but I'm not sure how under/over powered it'll be, will likely require a lot of tinkering over time.
Slightly increased Wand Tinkering Crystal's hitbox
Buffed Weirdo's Shield
