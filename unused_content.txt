This content is intended to be saved for later, to be added all in one big content update.
I may still add small things over time as I think of them, but keep them in a list here so I can keep track
of what I have & haven't finished implementing into the mod when I get around to putting them all in

Remember the checklist!!



Suspended Lava Tank - mods/mo_creeps/files/entities/props/suspended_tank_lava.xml
Essence of Fungus - mods/mo_creeps/files/entities/items/pickups/essence_fungus.xml (functional but can't redeem it anywhere)
