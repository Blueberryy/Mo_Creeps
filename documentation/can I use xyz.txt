If you want to use or be 'inspired' by any of the code in this mod, just go ahead and take it, I genuinely don't mind.

What would bother me is if you nicked the enemy sprites and claimed them as your own.
People don't recognise code when they see a mod, project, etc, but they do recognise sprites, story & gameplay.
I don't mean to sound malicious, but do ask you talk to me before taking any raw sprites from my mod.
If you want to take a sprite and use it as reference, modify into something completely new or whatever other tinkering then go ahead, my only gripe is ripping it raw.

And if you want to port any of the enemies in this mod 1:1 into one of your own projects,
I ask two things of you, the first is that you talk to me first to discuss implementation.
I can easily be contacted at Conga Lyne#2452 but also at congamailexpress@gmail.com if discord would be unpreferable, however I would prefer the former over the latter.
The second thing I ask for is credit for what I created.
