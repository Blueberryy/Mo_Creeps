Please do not use any sprites or voiceline audio from this mod.
I do not grant you permission to use any of the graphical work I have created for More Creeps & Weirdos in your own project by downloading this file, graphical work includes but is not limited to all ".png" and ".xml" file types within More Creeps as of download.
If you are interested in using any graphical work in your own projects, please talk to me first, it would be easiest for me to reach you at Conga Lyne#2452.

All files inside of Mo_Creeps/files/enemies_gfx/cats and any of it's sub-files are not created by me and I can not give permission for you to use them.



If you are interested in reusing any code, go ahead.
There's usually one best way to use code, but countless different unique ways to create pixel art with no one way being "correct".




If you want to port any of the enemies in this mod 1:1 into one of your own projects,
I ask two things of you, the first is that you talk to me first to discuss implementation.
I can easily be contacted at Conga Lyne#2452 but also at congamailexpress@gmail.com if discord would be unpreferable, however I would prefer the former over the latter and may take some time to respond via email.
The second thing I ask for is credit for what I created.
